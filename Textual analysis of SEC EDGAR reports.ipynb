Borrowings\\n\\n     In February  1998,  the Company and its banking group agreed to an increase\\nin the size of the  revolving  credit  agreement  from $300.0  million to $330.0\\nmillion for a period of one year.  After such time,  the level of debt available\\nunder such credit  agreement  was to be reduced to $300.0  million.  In December\\n1997,  February 1998 and April 1998,  certain  covenants in the credit agreement\\nwere also  modified  as of the end of 1997 and for a period  to end in  February\\n1999.  In June and July 1998,  the  Company  obtained  amendments  to its credit\\nagreement waiving all defaults of its financial  covenants through September 30,\\n1998.  The Company paid fees and  expenses of $1.7 million to its banking  group\\nand lawyers in connection with the amendments to the credit agreement.\\n\\n         On September 30, 1998, the Company  amended its credit  agreement.  The\\nseventh amendment eliminated all prior defaults and reinstated the original $300\\nmillion limit under the credit  facility.  The  amendment  allows the Company to\\nonce again classify the underlying  debt as long-term debt in the balance sheet.\\nThe restated credit agreement provides for permanent  reductions in availability\\nunder the  facility  of $25 million in  December  1998,  $25 million in December\\n1999, and $50 million in July 2000. The amended  facility  matures in July 2001.\\nFees of $.9 million were paid in  conjunction  with this  amendment  and will be\\namortized  over the remaining life of the debt,  beginning  October 1, 1998. The\\ninterest rate  incurred by the Company will vary each quarter  through July 2001\\ndepending on the Company\\'s consolidated debt to EBITDA (earnings before\\n\\n                                       8\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\\n                               September 30, 1998\\n           (Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\\n\\ninterest,  taxes,  depreciation,  amortization,  and certain noncash charges, as\\ndefined in the agreement)  ratio at the beginning of each quarter.  The new bank\\ncredit amendment  requires the Company to meet certain financial tests including\\nminimum EBITDA levels,  minimum  interest  coverage ratios and maximum  leverage\\nratios.  The Company posted a positive EBITDA performance of $6.1 million in the\\nquarter,  as measured by the bank  agreement.  The new agreement  limits capital\\nexpenditures to $3.6 million for the remainder of 1998;  $15.0 million for 1999;\\n$15.0 million for 2000; and $7.5 million for the first half of 2001.\\n\\n8.       Related Party Transactions\\n\\n         Effective March 31, 1998, the Company loaned $1.0 million to one of its\\nDirectors on an interest bearing note receivable.  This note accrues interest at\\n5.89%,  compounded  annually,  and is due on March  31,  2001.  Options  not yet\\nexercised  and  546,385  shares  of the  Company\\'s  common  stock  owned by this\\nDirector secure this note.\\n\\n9.       Restructuring Charges\\n\\n         The third quarter  restructuring charge of $5.7 million represents part\\nof  the  previously  announced  major  rationalization  plan  of  the  Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing  operations.  The plan includes  plant  consolidations,  equipment\\nrationalization moves, plant/product changes, warehouse consolidations,  as well\\nas new distribution centers. The rationalization is expected to result in an 18%\\nreduction  in  manufacturing  space  and  a net  7%  reduction  (250  employees,\\nprimarily in plant manufacturing) in the workforce.  Employee termination costs,\\nincluding  severance  and  benefits  totaled  $1.8  million.  Additionally,  the\\nrestructuring reserve includes closing costs to exit facilities of $2.5 million,\\nlease  termination  costs of $0.5  million,  and  property  taxes after  ceasing\\noperations of $0.9 million. As of September 30, 1998, there have been no charges\\nto the restructuring reserve.\\n\\n         Estimated  additional costs of $7.5 million associated with the plan do\\nnot qualify for current recognition but will be recorded primarily in 1999. Such\\ncosts include  equipment and inventory  transfer costs,  employee  retention and\\nrelocation,  recruiting  costs,  interim warehouse costs, and other training and\\nefficiency  costs.  The  major  undertakings  of the  rationalization  plan  are\\nexpected to be completed in 1999.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       9\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n     Item 2 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n         The  Company  is a leading  manufacturer  and  marketer  of  nationally\\nbranded and private label paper-based office products  (excluding copy paper) in\\nthe $60 billion to $70 billion North  American  office  products  industry.  The\\nCompany  offers a broad  assortment of products  including  writing  pads,  file\\nfolders,  envelopes and other paper-based products.  Through its Ampad division,\\nthe Company is among the largest suppliers of pads and other paper-based writing\\nproducts,  filing  supplies,  and retail  envelopes  to many of the  largest and\\nfastest growing office products distributors. Through its Williamhouse division,\\nthe Company is the leading  supplier of mill  branded  specialty  and  commodity\\nbusiness  envelopes to paper merchants and  distributors.  The Company  believes\\nthat its  future  operating  results  will  not be  directly  comparable  to its\\nhistorical  operating  results  because of its strategic  acquisitions.  Certain\\nfactors which have affected past and may affect future operating  results of the\\nCompany are discussed below.\\n\\n         Purchase  Accounting  Effects.  The  Company\\'s  acquisitions  have been\\naccounted for using the purchase  accounting method.  The aggregate  acquisition\\ncosts  (including  assumption of debt) are allocated to the net assets  acquired\\nbased  on the fair  market  value of such net  assets.  The  allocations  of the\\npurchase  price  result in an increase in the  historical  book value of certain\\nassets such as property,  plant and equipment and intangible  assets,  including\\ngoodwill,  which results in incremental  annual  depreciation  and  amortization\\nexpense each year.\\n\\n         Raw Material.  The Company\\'s  principal raw material is paper.  Certain\\ncommodity  grades  utilized  by  the  Company  have  shown   considerable  price\\nvolatility  since 1992.  From May 1997 through  October 1997, all but one of the\\nkey commodity grades of paper utilized by the Company increased significantly in\\ncost.  Due  to  strategic   customer   considerations   and  competitive  market\\nconditions,  the Company did not begin to recover a  significant  portion of the\\nincreases in paper costs  affecting both its divisions  until December 1997. The\\nCompany  continued to implement sales price  increases  during the first half of\\n1998.  Since October 1997,  the key  commodity  grades of paper  utilized by the\\nCompany  substantially  decreased  in cost.  Recently,  the  competitive  market\\nconditions have  necessitated that sales pricing for certain products follow the\\ndownward  trend in raw material  prices.  Paper price  volatility is expected to\\ncontinue  to have an  effect  on net  sales  and cost of sales  and  there is no\\nassurance   that  the  Company  will  not  be  materially   affected  by  future\\nfluctuations  in the price of paper.  Fluctuations  in paper  prices can have an\\neffect on  quarterly  comparisons  of the results of  operations  and  financial\\ncondition of the Company.\\n\\nRecent developments\\n\\n     Management Changes.  The Company appointed James W. Swent, III as Executive\\nVice President and Chief Financial  Officer on June 2,  respectively.  Mr. Swent\\nwas previously Chief Executive Officer of Cyrix  Corporation,  a manufacturer of\\nmicroprocessors   for  the  PC   industry,   until  its  merger  with   National\\nSemiconductor.  In addition,  he has held  operations  and  financial  executive\\npositions with companies, including Northern Telecom, Rodime PLC and Memorex. On\\nJuly 8, 1998, the Company  appointed Mr. Swent as Chief Executive  Officer and a\\nmember of its Board of Directors (\"Board\"). Mr. Swent replaced Charles G. Hanson\\nIII who retired from his position as Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer and\\ndirector of the Company.  Also,  Russel M. Gard  stepped  down as President  and\\nChief  Operating  Officer,  but will  continue his duties as Vice Chairman and a\\nmember of the Board. On July 20, 1998, the Company  appointed  William L. Morgan\\nas  Executive  Vice   President,   Operations.   Mr.  Morgan  has  35  years  of\\nmanufacturing  experience ranging from entrepreneurial  start-ups to large scale\\nmulti-national  corporations  including  Northern  Telecom,  Texas  Instruments,\\nMemorex and  Fujitsu.  John H.  Rodgers has been  appointed  to the  position of\\nSenior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.\\n\\n         On October 14, 1998, the Company  announced the  resignation of Timothy\\nNeedham, President and Chief Operating Officer.\\n\\n         Company   Initiatives/Restructuring.   Under  the   leadership  of  new\\nmanagement,  the Company has begun a review of all operations with the challenge\\nof  rebuilding  market  share,  reducing  debt  and  returning  the  company  to\\nprofitability.  On July 15, 1998, the Board approved the Company\\'s exit from the\\nforms business in its current form which has produced  unfavorable  margins.  As\\npart of the review process, the Company retained the management  consulting firm\\nof Bain & Company and the investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company to\\nassist the Company in evaluating its current  position in the marketplace and in\\nsetting the Company\\'s long term strategic direction. Goldman Sachs will explore\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       10\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n     Item 2 Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\nexternal  strategic and financial  alternatives to maximize  shareholder  value.\\nBain & Company will work closely with the  Company\\'s  customers and suppliers to\\nevaluate core strengths and identify  opportunities  for  improvement and assist\\nthe Company to  restructure  manufacturing  to best serve each of the  Company\\'s\\nmarkets.\\n\\n         The third quarter  restructuring charge of $5.7 million represents part\\nof  the  previously  announced  major  rationalization  plan  of  the  Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing  operations.  The plan includes  plant  consolidations,  equipment\\nrationalization moves, plant/product changes, warehouse consolidations,  as well\\nas new distribution centers. The rationalization is expected to result in an 18%\\nreduction  in  manufacturing  space  and  a net  7%  reduction  (250  employees,\\nprimarily in plant manufacturing) in the workforce.  Employee termination costs,\\nincluding  severance  and  benefits  totaled  $1.8  million.  Additionally,  the\\nrestructuring reserve includes closing costs to exit facilities of $2.5 million,\\nlease  termination  costs of $0.5  million,  and  property  taxes after  ceasing\\noperations of $0.9 million. Estimated capital costs of $2.8 million and one-time\\nimplementation costs of $7.5 million that do not qualify for current recognition\\nwill be recorded  primarily in 1999. Such costs include  equipment and inventory\\ntransfer costs,  employee  retention and relocation,  recruiting costs,  interim\\nwarehouse costs, and other training and efficiency costs. The major undertakings\\nof the  rationalization  plan are expected to be  completed  in 1999.  Upon full\\nimplementation,  the plan is expected to have a significant  positive  effect on\\nthe  Company\\'s  financial  performance,  resulting  in an  estimated  annualized\\nincrease in operating income of $10-12 million.\\n\\n         Covenant Violations/  Negotiation to Modify Agreement. On September 30,\\n1998, the Company amended its credit agreement. The seventh amendment eliminated\\nall prior  defaults and  reinstated  the original  $300 million  limit under the\\ncredit  facility.  The amendment  allows the Company to once again  classify the\\nunderlying  debt as long-term  debt in the balance  sheet.  The restated  credit\\nagreement  provides for permanent  reductions in availability under the facility\\nof $25 million in December  1998,  $25 million in December 1999, and $50 million\\nin July 2000.  The amended  facility  matures in July 2001.  Fees of $.9 million\\nwere paid in  conjunction  with this  amendment  and will be amortized  over the\\nremaining  life of the debt,  beginning  October  1,  1998.  The  interest  rate\\nincurred by the Company  will vary each quarter  through July 2001  depending on\\nthe Company\\'s  consolidated  debt to EBITDA (earnings  before  interest,  taxes,\\ndepreciation,  amortization,  and  certain  noncash  charges,  as defined in the\\nagreement) ratio at the beginning of each quarter. The new bank credit amendment\\nrequires the Company to meet certain  financial tests  including  minimum EBITDA\\nlevels,  minimum  interest  coverage  ratios and maximum  leverage  ratios.

The net sales decrease is comprised of a $2.0\\nmillion increase in sales, principally due to favorable mix, partially offset by\\nan  unfavorable  volume  variance.  The  increased  sales were  primarily in the\\ncontract stationer and superstore  channels.  This increase was more than offset\\nby a $4.3  million  increase  in customer  incentives.  The  increased  customer\\nincentives  are due to additional  rebate  programs  caused by more  competitive\\npricing,  changing  product mix, higher volumes  resulting in certain  customers\\nreaching the next  incentive  tier level and  write-offs  related to the loss of\\ncertain unprofitable forms business and a major customer.\\n\\n     Gross  Profit for the three months ended  September  30, 1998  decreased by\\n$8.6 million, or 32.7%, to $17.7 million from $26.3 million for the three months\\nended September 30, 1997.  Gross profit margin  decreased to 10.2% for the three\\nmonths ended  September 30, 1998 from 14.9% for the three months ended September\\n30,1997. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to higher\\nunit production costs due to underutilized capacity resulting from the Company\\'s\\nefforts  to  reduce  its  inventory,  a  reduction  in  selling  margins  due to\\ncompetitive  pricing  pressures,  and the lower sales.  In  addition,  the third\\nquarter of 1998 includes  approximately  $2.9 million of charges for  additional\\nobsolescence reserves.\\n\\n     Selling and  marketing  expenses for the three months ended  September  30,\\n1998  increased to $5.6 million,  or 3.2% of sales from $5.5 million or 3.1% for\\nthe three months ended September 30, 1997.\\n\\n         General  and  administrative   expenses  for  the  three  months  ended\\nSeptember  30, 1998  increased  to $9.6  million from $6.3 million for the three\\nmonths ended  September 30, 1997, an increase of $3.3 million.  This increase is\\nprimarily attributable to $2.2 million of severance and consulting costs paid to\\ncertain  former  executives  of the company  and $1.4  million of Bain & Company\\nconsulting fees related to work on the Company\\'s restructuring.\\n\\n         Restructuring  charges for the three months ended September 30, 1998 of\\n$5.7 million represents part of the previously  described major  rationalization\\nplan of the Company\\'s manufacturing operations.\\n\\n         Losses  on sales of  accounts  receivable  for the three  months  ended\\nSeptember  30, 1998  increased  to $0.9  million from $0.7 million for the three\\nmonths  ended  September  30, 1997 due  primarily to a higher  average  level of\\naccounts receivable sold to the third party trust in the third quarter of 1998.\\n\\n         Goodwill and intangible asset amortization expense for the three months\\nended  September  30, 1998  decreased  to $1.3 million from $1.7 million for the\\nthree months ended September 30, 1997, an decrease of $0.4 million primarily due\\nto the write-off of the Shade/Allied goodwill in the second quarter of 1998.\\n\\n     Management  fees and services  expense for the three months ended September\\n30,  1998  amounted  to $0.6  million as  compared  to $.6 million for the three\\nmonths ended September 30,1997.\\n\\n         Interest  expense  for  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  1998\\nincreased  to $11.9  million  from  $9.8  million  for the  three  months  ended\\nSeptember 30, 1997, an increase of $2.1 million. Of this increase,  $0.2 million\\nis  attributable  to increased  debt levels,  $0.8  million is  attributable  to\\nincreased interest rates and $1.1 million is attributable to the amortization of\\nfees paid in  connection  with  amendments to the credit  agreement  obtained in\\nFebruary and July 1998 and other costs.\\n\\n     The income tax  provision  for the three month period ended  September  30,\\n1998  reflects an effective  tax rate of 24.5%  versus an effective  tax rate of\\n45.0% for the three month period ended  September 30, 1997.  Due to the expected\\nlower operating results for 1998 and higher non-deductible  expenses as a result\\nof the write-down of intangible  assets associated with the decision to exit the\\nShade/Allied continuous forms business, the Company lowered its effective income\\ntax rate in 1998.\\n\\n                                       13\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\nNine months ended September 30, 1998 compared to nine months ended September 30,\\n1997\\n\\n         Net Sales for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1998  decreased by\\n$11.0  million,  or 2.2%,  to $482.5  million  from $493.5  million for the nine\\nmonths ended  September 30, 1997. This net sales decrease is comprised of a $6.2\\nmillion  increase  in sales  offset  by a $16.9  million  increase  in  customer\\nincentives and a $0.3 million increase in cash discounts. The net sales increase\\nis  primarily  attributable  to  favorable  mix and price  variances  and owning\\nShade/Allied ($3.3 million) for nine months of 1998 versus only seven and a half\\nmonths in the same  period in 1997,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable  volumes\\nvariance.  The sales increase occurred  primarily in the contract  stationer and\\nmass market channels.  The increased  customer  incentives are due to additional\\nrebate programs caused by more competitive pricing, changing product mix, higher\\nvolumes  resulting in certain  customers  reaching the next incentive tier level\\nand write-offs related to the loss of certain  unprofitable forms business and a\\nmajor customer.\\n\\n         Gross Profit for the nine months ended  September 30, 1998 decreased by\\n$45.7 million, or 53.0%, to $40.5 million from $86.2 million for the nine months\\nended  September 30, 1997.  Gross profit  margin  decreased to 8.4% for the nine\\nmonths ended  September 30, 1998 from 17.5% for the nine months ended  September\\n30,  1997.  The decrease in gross profit  margin is  primarily  attributable  to\\nhigher unit production  costs due to underutilized  capacity  resulting from the\\nCompany\\'s efforts to reduce its inventory, a reduction in selling margins due to\\ncompetitive  pricing  pressures,  and the lower sales.  In addition,  the second\\nquarter of 1998 included  approximately  $7.5 million of charges  resulting from\\nreevaluating  certain  inventories based on changes in current market conditions\\nand accruals for workers\\' compensation and property tax and the third quarter of\\n1998 includes approximately $2.9 million of charges for additional  obsolescence\\nreserves.\\n\\n         Selling and marketing  expenses for the nine months ended September 30,\\n1998 increased to $15.8 million,  or 3.3% of sales, from $15.6 million,  or 3.2%\\nof sales,  for the nine months ended  September  30, 1997.  The increase of $0.2\\nmillion,  or 0.1% of sales  was  comprised  primarily  of  severance  costs  and\\nincreased commissions related to the higher gross sales.\\n\\n         General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September\\n30, 1998 increased to $24.3 million from $14.7 million for the nine months ended\\nSeptember  30,1997,  an increase of $9.6  million.  This  increase is  primarily\\nattributable  to $2.2 million of severance and consulting  costs paid to certain\\nformer executives of the company, $1.9 million of Bain & Company consulting fees\\nrelated to work on the Company\\'s  restructuring,  the Company\\'s  second  quarter\\nreevaluation of certain assets which resulted in $1.7 million of current charges\\nfor additional allowance for doubtful accounts stemming from customer deductions\\nand one time severance and litigation costs of $1.3 million. Of the remainder of\\nthe increase,  $0.1 million is attributable to owning  Shade/Allied for the full\\nfirst half of 1998 versus only four and a half months in the same period in 1997\\nand one time charges associated with centralizing certain functions in Dallas.\\n\\n         Restructuring  charges for the nine months ended  September 30, 1998 of\\n$5.7 million represents part of the previously  announced major  rationalization\\nplan of the Company\\'s manufacturing operations.\\n\\n         Losses  on sales of  accounts  receivable  for the  nine  months  ended\\nSeptember  30, 1998  increased  to $2.3  million  from $2.0 million for the nine\\nmonths  ended  September  30, 1997 due  primarily to a higher  average  level of\\naccounts  receivable  sold to the third party trust in 1998 and slightly  higher\\naverage interest rates.\\n\\n         Goodwill and intangible asset amortization  expense for the nine months\\nended September 30, 1998 of $4.5 million remained unchanged from the nine months\\nended September 30, 1997.\\n\\n         Write-down of Intangible  Assets  expense of $41.0 million for the nine\\nmonths ended September 30,1998 reflects a write-off of goodwill and a write-down\\nof intangible assets associated with the Shade/Allied  continuous forms business\\nresulting from the Company\\'s  decision to exit the forms business in its current\\nform.\\n\\n\\n                                       14\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                           AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\n         Management  fees  and  services  expense  for  the  nine  months  ended\\nSeptember  30, 1998 amounted to $1.7 million as compared to $4.3 million for the\\nnine months ended  September  30,  1997.  The change in  management  fees is due\\nprimarily  to a  one-year  non-recurring  consulting  agreement  with the former\\npresident of Niagara, which expired June 30, 1997.\\n\\n         Interest expense for the nine months ended September  30,1998 increased\\nto $33.7  million  from $27.6  million for the nine months ended  September  30,\\n1997,  an  increase  of  $6.1  million.  Of  this  increase,   $3.0  million  is\\nattributable to increased debt levels, $1.4 million is attributable to increased\\ninterest rates and $1.7 million is  attributable to amortization of fees paid in\\nconnection with amendments to the credit agreement obtained in February and July\\n1998 and other costs.\\n\\n     The income tax provision for the nine month period ended September 30, 1998\\nreflects an effective  tax rate of 19.1%  versus an effective  tax rate of 45.0%\\nfor the nine month period ended  September 30, 1997.  Due to the expected  lower\\noperating results for 1998 and higher non-deductible expenses as a result of the\\nwrite-down  of  intangible  assets  associated  with  the  decision  to exit the\\nShade/Allied continuous forms business, the Company lowered its effective income\\ntax rate in 1998.\\n\\nKnown Trends and Seasonality\\n\\n         The Company  experiences some  seasonality in its business  operations.\\nDuring the Company\\'s third and fourth quarters, net sales tend to be higher than\\nin the  first  and  second  quarters  due to sales of  back-to-school,  seasonal\\ngreeting card and tax filing products.\\n\\n         The Company\\'s Ampad division sells primarily to fast growing  customers\\nsuch as office  products  superstores,  mass  merchants  and  national  contract\\nstationers.  Such customers  periodically  adjust the levels of inventory in the\\nretail  distribution  channels,  either  in  retail  stores  or in  distribution\\ncenters.  The Company has  determined  that lower than expected sales will occur\\nduring the quarters in which such downward  adjustments are made. The Company is\\nnot able to predict the future effect of such adjustments; however, it is likely\\nthat its retail  customers  will continue to adjust  inventory  levels in future\\nquarters.\\n\\n         The  Company\\'s  gross  profit is  directly  affected  by,  among  other\\nfactors,  the mix of  products  sold.  Based on the  Company\\'s  current  product\\ncategories, the Company\\'s gross profit will be negatively or positively affected\\nas the actual product sales mix changes.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\n     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for the nine  months  ended\\nSeptember  30, 1998 was $30.3  million as compared to net cash used by operating\\nactivities for the nine months ended  September 30, 1997 of $30.3 million.  This\\nincrease is primarily the net result of the following:  (i) cash used by the net\\nloss of $23.3 million after adjustment for non-cash expenses, (ii) a decrease in\\naccounts  receivable  of $27.2  million  as a result  of  improving  days  sales\\noutstanding  in  receivables,  (iii) a decrease in inventories of $24.8 million,\\n(iv) a reduction of accounts  payable of $13.7 million,  and (v) a net change in\\nall other assets and liabilities of $15.3 million.\\n\\n         Cash used in investing  activities for the nine months ended  September\\n30, 1998 and 1997 was $11.2 million and $62.8  million,  respectively.  The nine\\nmonths  ended  September  30,  1998 use was due to the  purchase  of  equipment,\\nprincipally  production equipment.  The nine months ended September 30, 1997 use\\nwas due to the  Shade/Allied  acquisition  of $50.7  million  and  purchases  of\\nequipment of $15.4 million.\\n\\n         Net cash provided by financing  activities during the first nine months\\nof 1998 and 1997 was $9.2  million  and $91.5  million,  respectively.  Net cash\\nprovided  during the nine months ended  September 30, 1998 resulted from the net\\nof the  repayment of $2.0 million in  financing  outstanding  under the accounts\\nreceivable credit facility, $1.1 million of repayment of long-term debt, payment\\nof fees in  connection  with  amendments  to the bank credit  agreement  of $2.0\\nmillion and borrowings of $14.4 million under the bank credit agreement.  During\\nthe nine months ended September 30, 1997, the Company  borrowed $99.4 million to\\nfinance  (i)  repayment  of $7.0  million  in  financing  outstanding  under its\\naccounts receivable credit facility, (ii) the acquisition of Shade/Allied, (iii)\\nthe purchases of equipment and (iv) its working capital needs.\\n\\n\\n                                       15\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\n         A portion of the  consolidated  debt of the Company  bears  interest at\\nfloating rates;  therefore,  its financial  condition is and will continue to be\\naffected by changes in prevailing  interest rates.  The Company has entered into\\nan interest rate cap to reduce the impact from a rise in interest rates.\\n\\n         In  February  1998,  the Company  and its  banking  group  agreed to an\\nincrease in the size of the revolving  credit  agreement  from $300.0 million to\\n$330.0  million  for a period of one year.  After such  time,  the level of debt\\navailable under such credit  agreement was to be reduced to $300.0  million.  In\\nDecember  1997,  February 1998 and April 1998,  certain  covenants in the credit\\nagreement  were also  modified  as of the end of 1997 and for a period to end in\\nFebruary  1999. In June and July 1998,  the Company  obtained  amendments to its\\ncredit  agreement  waiving  all  defaults  of  it  financial  covenants  through\\nSeptember  30,  1998.  The Company paid fees and expenses of $1.7 million to its\\nbanking  group and  lawyers  in  connection  with the  amendments  to the credit\\nagreement.\\n\\n         On September 30, 1998, the Company  amended its credit  agreement.  The\\nseventh amendment eliminated all prior defaults and reinstated the original $300\\nmillion limit under the credit  facility.  The  amendment  allows the Company to\\nonce again classify the underlying  debt as long-term debt in the balance sheet.\\nThe restated credit agreement provides for permanent  reductions in availability\\nunder the  facility  of $25 million in  December  1998,  $25 million in December\\n1999, and $50 million in July 2000. The amended  facility  matures in July 2001.\\nFees of $.9 million were paid in  conjunction  with this  amendment  and will be\\namortized  over the remaining life of the debt,  beginning  October 1, 1998. The\\ninterest rate  incurred by the Company will vary each quarter  through July 2001\\ndepending  on  the  Company\\'s  consolidated  debt  to  EBITDA  (earnings  before\\ninterest,  taxes,  depreciation,  amortization,  and certain noncash charges, as\\ndefined in the agreement)  ratio at the beginning of each quarter.  The new bank\\ncredit amendment  requires the Company to meet certain financial tests including\\nminimum EBITDA levels,  minimum  interest  coverage ratios and maximum  leverage\\nratios.  The Company posted a positive EBITDA performance of $6.1 million in the\\nquarter,  as measured by the bank  agreement.  The new agreement  limits capital\\nexpenditures  to $3.6  million the  remainder of 1998;  $15.0  million for 1999;\\n$15.0 million for 2000; and $7.5 million for the first half of 2001.\\n\\n         The ability of the  Company to meet its debt  service  obligations  and\\nreduce  its total debt will be  dependent  upon the  future  performance  of the\\nCompany  and its  subsidiaries.  In turn,  such  performance  will be subject to\\ngeneral  economic  conditions  and to  financial,  business  and other  factors,\\nincluding factors beyond the Company\\'s control.\\n\\n     Although there can be no assurance,  management  believes that,  based upon\\ncash on hand of $33.2  million at September  30, 1998,  estimates of current and\\nfuture operations,  and other available sources of funds, including availability\\nunder  the  bank  credit  agreement  and the  accounts  receivable  facility  at\\nSeptember 30, 1998 of $15.7 million,  its finances will be adequate for 1998 and\\n1999 to make  required  payments of  principal  and  interest  on the  Company\\'s\\nindebtedness,  to fund anticipated  capital  expenditures of approximately  $3.6\\nmillion during the remainder of 1998, and to meet working capital requirements.\\n\\nYear 2000 Issue\\n\\n         The Year 2000 issue is the result of  date-sensitive  devices,  systems\\nand computer  programs  which were deployed  using only two digits,  rather than\\nfour, to represent the applicable  year. Any such  technologies  may recognize a\\nyear  containing  \"00\" as the  year  1900  rather  than the  year  2000.  If not\\ncorrected, many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results.\\n\\n         The  Company  recognizes  the need to ensure  that its  operations  and\\nrelationships  with  vendors,  customers and other parties will not be adversely\\nimpacted by software or other processing errors arising from calculations  using\\nthe year 2000 and  beyond.  Like many  companies,  a  significant  number of the\\nCompany\\'s  computer  applications  and systems require  modification in order to\\nrender  these  systems  Year 2000  compliant.  Failure by the  Company to timely\\nresolve Year 2000 issues could result, in the worst case, in an inability of the\\nCompany to  manufacture  and distribute its product to customers and process its\\ndaily business for some period of time. However, based on the progress made to\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       16\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\ndate in its Year 2000  remediation  plan,  the Company  believes  the worst case\\nscenario is  unlikely.  Failure to address Year 2000 issues by one or more third\\nparty service providers on whom the Company relies could also result, in a worst\\ncase scenario,  in some business  interruption.  The amount of lost revenues, if\\nany, resulting from a worst case scenario such as those examples described above\\nwould depend on the period of time over which the failure goes  uncorrected  and\\nthe breadth of its impact.\\n\\n         The Company has recently  purchased a new certified Year 2000 compliant\\nversion  of  its   existing   software   to  upgrade   critical   manufacturing,\\ndistribution,   and  financial  applications.   The  upgrade  is  scheduled  for\\ncompletion and full installation by December 31, 1999. While the primary purpose\\nof the software upgrade is to modernize and improve the Company\\'s operations, it\\nis also  expected  to resolve any Year 2000  issues in these  critical  computer\\nsystems.   Costs  to  acquire  the  software  and  related  hardware  are  being\\ncapitalized in accordance  with SOP 98-1  \"Accounting  for the Costs of Computer\\nSoftware Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.\" Costs to implement the upgrade\\nand other costs  relating to Year 2000  readiness are being expensed as incurred\\nas required by generally accepted accounting  principles.  Through September 30,\\n1998, capital  expenditures to purchase software and related hardware total $1.5\\nmillion and non-capital  expenditures for Year 2000 readiness are  approximately\\n$140,000.  To complete Year 2000 readiness,  $.5 million of capital expenditures\\nwill be incurred to complete the  purchase of the software and related  hardware\\nand  approximately  $1.5 -2.0  million is expected to be spent  through 1999 for\\nimplementation  of the upgraded  software,  consultant costs and other Year 2000\\nreadiness costs. The Company will fund these expenditures  through its operating\\ncash flow. At this time, other than the cost of implementing its new information\\nsystem,  the Company does not believe that the costs of addressing the Year 2000\\nissue will be  material.  The Company  has  increased  its  overall  information\\nsystems budget to accommodate the  implementation  of the upgraded  software and\\nYear 2000  compliance  projects and has not delayed other  critical  information\\nsystems work due to its Year 2000 efforts.\\n\\n         In addition to the software upgrade, a Company-wide committee of senior\\nexecutives  representing  all functional areas has been established to identify,\\nevaluate  and  initiate  corrective  actions  in  order  to  achieve  Year  2000\\nreadiness.  The  committee  has  completed  the  process of taking the  relevant\\ninventory,  assessing  risk  and  assigning  priorities  to  various  tasks  and\\nperforming limited internal tests relative to the Company\\'s critical  functions.\\nThe  committee  determined  that the  Company\\'s  primary  hardware and operating\\nsystems,  which were installed in 1997, and the program supporting the Company\\'s\\nelectronic data interchange are already Year 2000 compliant.  With regard to the\\nCompany\\'s  manufacturing and other non-IT readiness for Year 2000, the Committee\\nhas not identified any issues that would have a material,  adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s operations\\'  processes.  The committee has developed contingency plans\\nfor the Company\\'s critical  information system which primarily consist of making\\nits  existing  information  system  Year 2000  compliant  in the event  that the\\nsoftware   upgrade  is  not  completed  by  the  scheduled  date.  In  addition,\\ncontingency plans have included the development of manual intervention processes\\nfor critical functions.  The committee\\'s  expectation is that the remedial tasks\\nrelative to the Company\\'s  critical functions will be completed by June 30, 1999\\nand that full  integrated  testing will be  completed  by December 31, 1999.  In\\naddition,  the committee has requested and received  documentation  from all key\\ncustomers,  suppliers and other business partners that their  organizations will\\nbe ready  for the year  2000.  While the  Company  cannot  warrant  that all the\\nsystems of our business partners will be Year 2000 compliant, based on currently\\navailable  information,  the Company  expects no business  interruptions  due to\\nnon-compliance by any particular entity.\\n\\n         There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the\\ninstallation  of the  upgraded  software  and all of the  remedial  tasks in the\\nrequired time frame, that unanticipated  events will not occur, that the Company\\nwill be able to  identify  all Year 2000  issues  before the  problems  manifest\\nthemselves,  that  third  party  systems  will be Year 2000  compliant  and that\\nCompany\\'s estimate of Year 2000 costs will not require revision if unanticipated\\nadverse developments occur.  However,  management believes the Company is taking\\nadequate  action to address Year 2000 issues.  Based on a current  assessment of\\nrisks  relating to its Year 2000  readiness,  the Company  does not believe Year\\n2000  issues  will  materially  affect  future  financial  results or  operating\\nperformance.\\n\\n                                       17\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\nInflation\\n\\n         The Company  believes that  inflation has not had a material  impact on\\nits results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,1998 and 1997.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       18\\n<PAGE>\\n\\n                          AMERICAN PAD & PAPER COMPANY\\n         Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\n                              Results of Operations\\n                                   (continued)\\n\\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\\n\\n         The Accounting  Standards  Executive Committee (AcSEC) issued Statement\\nof Position  (SOP) 98-5,  which is effective for fiscal years  commencing  after\\nDecember 15,  1998.

The  plaintiffs  in the first two  complaints  purport to represent a\\nclass of stockholders  who acquired shares of the Company\\'s common stock between\\nJuly 2, 1996 and December 17, 1997. The complaints seek unspecified  damages and\\nother relief under the federal  securities  laws based on  allegations  that the\\nCompany made  omissions and  misleading  disclosures in public reports and press\\nreleases  and to  securities  analysts  during  1996  and  1997  concerning  the\\nCompany\\'s financial  condition,  its future business prospects and the impact of\\nvarious acquisitions.  These two lawsuits were consolidated on July 2, 1998. The\\nthird  complaint was dismissed  without  prejudice by the plaintiffs on June 29,\\n1998.  Motions to dismiss have been filed in the consolidated cases but briefing\\nwill not be concluded  until  January  1999.  Pending a ruling on the motions to\\ndismiss,  all proceedings in the  consolidated  action have been stayed.  To the\\nextent that the  motions to dismiss are denied in whole or in part,  the Company\\nbelieves that it has meritorious  defenses to plaintiff\\'s  claims and intends to\\nvigorously defend the action.\\n\\nITEM 2            Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds\\n\\n         During the period,  in partial  consideration  for their  agreement  to\\nserve as employees  and  executive  officers of the  Company,  three newly hired\\nexecutives were granted  options,  with effective dates of September 3, 1998 and\\nSeptember  21, 1998 to purchase an aggregate of 900,000  shares of the Company\\'s\\ncommon stock, par value $.01, at a weighted average price of approximately $2.05\\nper share.

This plant,  which\\nemployees  approximately 175 people,  will continue operations at reduced levels\\nthrough  the end of May 1999.

Swent III,  Chief  Executive\\nOfficer of American  Pad & Paper said,  \"I sincerely  regret that some  employee\\nreductions  are necessary,  but the future of our Company  depends on a strategy\\nthat  provides  greater  efficiency  and a return to  profitable  growth.  These\\nactions are  necessary  to improve both  service to our  customers,  and move us\\ncloser to our goal of being the lowest cost manufacturer in our industry.\"\\n\\n     American  Pad & Paper  Company is a leading  manufacturer  and  marketer of\\npaper-based  office  products  in  North  America.
